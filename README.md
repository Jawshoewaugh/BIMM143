**Everything I did!**

*First, I began working with R!*

Class 5 - [Data exploration and visualization in R](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class05/class05quarto.qmd)

Class 6 - [R functions and R packages from CRAN and BioConductor](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class6/clas06.qmd)
and wrote my first function! [Check it out :)](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class06hw/class06hwpdf.qmd)

*Then, I got to work with datasets for Bioinformatics Analyses.*

Class 7 - [An Intro to Machine Learning for Bioinformatics](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class07/Class07Lab.qmd)

Class 9 - [Halloween Candy Mini-Project](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class9/lab10.qmd)

Class 10 - [Structural Bioinformatics Pt. 1](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class9/lab10.qmd)

Class 11 - [Structural Bioinformatics w/ Focus on new AlphaFold2](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class11/class11.qmd)

Class 12 - [Genome informatics](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class12/class12hw.qmd)

Class 13 - [Transcriptomics and the analysis of RNA-Seq data](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class13/class13lab.qmd)
this was probably my favorite topic.

Class 14 - [RNA-Seq analysis mini-project](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class14/class14miniproject.qmd)

Class 17 - [Analyzing sequencing data in the cloud](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class17/class17.qmd)
and this one was probably the most troublesome.

Class 18 - [Mini Project: Investigating Pertussis Resurgence](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class18/class17.qmd)

This was my bioinformatics journey! As difficult as it was, I had great help, and I had fun.
