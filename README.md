**Everything I did!**

*First, I began working with R!*

Class 5 - [Data exploration and visualization in R](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class05/class05quarto.qmd)

Class 6 - [R functions and R packages from CRAN and BioConductor](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class6/clas06.qmd)
and wrote my first function! [Check it out](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class06hw/class06hwpdf.qmd)

*Then, I got to work with datasets.*

Class 7 - [An Intro to Machine Learning for Bioinformatics](https://github.com/Jawshoewaugh/BIMM143/blob/main/class07/Class07Lab.qmd)
